AFXBot is an IRC bot that uses encrypted text to communicate admin
commands. The admin uses the included mIRC script to encrypt and
decrypt messages. Only a person with the admin key and password can
execute commands.

The included script should only be used for communicating with
AFXbots because it will interfere with other scripts and "normal"
IRC use.

  What you see:

     <Aphex> .login pwd
     <Bot> password accepted

  What everyone else sees:

     <Aphex> x46x12x65x91x30x57
     <Bot> x51x96x48x38x97x41x96x06x85x34x89x34x32x76x98x43x76


Also, commands can be executed in silent mode by adding the '-s' flag
to the command.

  Example: .remove -s
