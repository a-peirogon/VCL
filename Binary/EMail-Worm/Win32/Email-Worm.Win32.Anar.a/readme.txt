I have some thingz to code into next Release. eg HTTP proxy server,
proxy servers support (under LANs) etc. Next release could be in some
weeks (2 or 3).

If you find any bug in the code or you could anything code better,
lemme know. I'll be glad to learn anything new.

I have tested it on my Win2k and some previous versions on Win9x too. 
Pls test if you want and lemme know whether it werx or not. I'll
repair the bugz of coz and release new version.
