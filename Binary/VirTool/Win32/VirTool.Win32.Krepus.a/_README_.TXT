        Finaly my 32bit poly engine is ready in a beta test demo.
        Here is how to use this demo and how to check the poly stuff:

        - firstly, remember to keep the file SAMPLE.EXE in the same
          directory with LJ_MOF32.EXE!!

          Sample.exe is the file that will get encrypted and will get
          a poly decryptor.

        - Run LJ_MOF32.EXE

        - You will see ten new files generated (000.exe, ..., 009.exe)

        - When ran, these files will decrypt themselves and run just
          like Sample.exe

        You  can try the poly with other sample files, but just look at the
 sample.asm file to understand exactly how this demo is handling the file.

        Remeber this is a beta test!! More to come soon!!!

        Good luck now,

                                Lord Julus
