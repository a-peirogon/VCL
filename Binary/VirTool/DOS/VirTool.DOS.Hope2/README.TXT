Huge Overhead Polymorphic Engine

The overhead of this engine isn't actually very 'Huge' at all, the name
just came about due to its modular design which has a lot of module
parsing and headers etc.. causing it to be quite a generic polymorphic
engine (GPE?).

All version numbers are internal version numbers until official release.

This engine is not a virus, nor is it designed to release one on your
system. It is a utility for linking into your own programs to make them
polymorphic.
