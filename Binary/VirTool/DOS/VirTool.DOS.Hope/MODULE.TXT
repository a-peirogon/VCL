          See DEFINIT.TXT for detailed info on module structure...

 There are several rules which must be followed to create workable modules.

      The first module in the module set must be labelled as following:

       Junk Modules   -> JUNKSTART:
       Crypt Modules  -> CRYPTSTART:
       Loop Modules   -> LOOPSTART:
       Init Modules   -> INITSTART:
       Count Modules  -> COUNTSTART:

     The last module in each set must point to the first in the same set.

	* Junk must never modify the SPINDEX register
	* Never have a conditional jmp over unknown junk based on spare regs
          or uninitialised registers.
        * Each module's size should never exceed 32 bytes.
	* Only assume DS=CS if you specify it in the header
	* Make sure to include complement modules for modules that rely on 
          others existance


        The forward reference over an undetermined amount of junk is quite
        complicated, and it is necessary to understand how it works in order
        to use it effectively.

Hints:

        Don't be afraid to use the codes for uses other than what they're
        designed for. The Any register code is useful for modifying opcodes
        within a range, if you can, then do, as it will make your decryptor
        much more polymorphic. (Remember that the any register code will not
        return '4' as it does not use the SP, you could however use the any
        arith code)
