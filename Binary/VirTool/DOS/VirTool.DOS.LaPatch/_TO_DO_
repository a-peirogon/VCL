*** WHAT TO DO BEFORE SPREADING

* Test using both Borland and Watcom compilers
* Test second PM generations (4 (5?) modes)
  a. BC++ 4.5 w/out TASM
  b. BC++ 4.5 with TASM
  c. BC++ 5.01 w/out TASM
  d. BC++ 5.01 with TASM
  e. Watcom C
* Remove logging
* Set up "//Declaration"
* Check for "static char whatevershit[666]"
* Check import table for NT-specific DLLs
* ";;" after "}" (1st function statement}

*** TODO LIST      16-02-98 19:52:07

  1. Add PM mode if possible : BC 4.5 with TASM
+ 2. Improve S&D data/code separation (512b sections)
  3.
+  a. Enable Win95 invis mode (Borland)
+  b. Asm to WatcomC
- 4. Fix 16-bit execution - disable DEBUG_PROCESS for NEs ????
   Using 32bit control for 16WOA/32VDMs was _an_error_
  5. Add extensions (test first)
   a. .CPL
   b. .SCR
  6. Encrypt file
  7. Goat avoidance
+  a. Names with numbers
+  b. 1,2-symbol names
+  c. Files with xx00 length
+  d. Files in root directory
+  e. Files that were just created.
  8. Archives infection (except with subdirs?)
   a. ARJ param : ARJ -P filename.arj \*.EXE
- 9. Unload AVP.VXD (I don't need it right now)
-10. Crash system when AVP for Win32 is running (? Hmm.. suspicious)
+11. Add password grabbing (local storage)
+12. Add password emailing
-13. More random : force "C++ only" mutation even if BC+TASM were found
+14. BUG: TASM32 running out of hashspace
+15. Search for valid XRASCONN struc size (between 4 and 100h)
+16. Fix logging cr/lf handling
+17. Fix message encryption - do not encrypt "\xD"s
+18. New residency check (via FindWindow instead of fuckin' atoms)
+19. Do not infect system kernel files and DLLs
+20. Send mail only once a day
+21. Check if permanent network available in IsConnectionAvailable
*22. Check if WIN.INI is write-protected, and do not activate if yes
+23. BUG?: Namefiltering ain't working
*24. Files with names containing "\\SYSBCKUP" must not be modified
     "\\FAILSAFE"
+25. Files that are just created cannot be modified because this
     may cause SETUP application to fail. This can also be a goat avoidace.
+26. BUG: Invalid commandline parameters are passed to the app
