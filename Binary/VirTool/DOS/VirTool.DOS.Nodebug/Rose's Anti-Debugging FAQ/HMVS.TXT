Also known as the magic worm (hi Dark Stalker, StoneHead)


         the protection that HMVS uses is quite clever 'cos it checks the
         first 16 kBytes for the instruction sequence of

         mov si,SI_MAGIC
         mov di,DI_MAGIC

         they're encoded as 0BE,x,y,0BF,u,v where x,y,u and v are the magic
         values. when HMVS finds 0BE and 0BF separated by two bytes from each
         other then it calls INT3 with the supposed magic values (the INT3
         handler is a simple IRET, so no problem should arise if SOFT-ICE is
         not installed). and guess what happens when HMVS finds the traces
         of the loader part of SOFT-ICE in that low memory area...
