NO MORE annoying anti SOFT-ICE tricks!

Crashing SOFT-ICE seems to be a very
popular method against debugging exe
protection schemes. Most methods use
the INT3 interface or other obscure INT
calls (INT01/ICEBP,INT06,INT07,INT08).

The files included here will let you
change the magic values of the INT3
interface of SOFT-ICE to anything you
want and will also describe a few
patches to improve SOFT-ICE!

[you'll need MSUB.EXE - look for
MSUB13.ZIP in ftp sites]

companion programs must also be changed!

The patches were tested with the following
versions: DOS v2.80 and Win3 v1.52,
however they should work (perhaps with a
few modifications) for other versions, too.
