# OnyxLocker
OnyxLocker is a **proof of concept** ransomware writen in the C# language using the .NET framework

## Features
* Fast file processing
* XXTEA algorithm
* Classes should be easily swappable due to the use of interfaces

## Requirements
* .NET 4.5.2
* I used visual studio 2019, not sure on how it loads on other versions but you should be fine.

## Todo
* Send data to a webserver, e.g the encryption keys
* Test on other platforms

## Warning
I wrote this for fun, I find malware interesting and I hope you do so too. Use this on computers on which you have the authorization to do so.
This program was not tested thoroughly so there might be bugs. I'm also not the best in C# so there might be room for improvement as well.
