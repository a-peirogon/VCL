   short description :

   w32.mimee is written in visual basic 6 and targets .eml files... when executed, it spawns
   mime.exe in c:\, searches for .eml in harddrive and infects them by adding itself as an
   attachment.. .eml files which are saved in rich text (html), whether or not they contain
   attachments, will be successfully infected by w32.mimee... .eml files that are saved in plain
   text and are having one or many attachments will also be infected by the virus... .eml files
   that are saved in plain text and are containing no attachments won't be successfully infected...

   win32.mimee inserts a signature in files that it infects so they won't be reinfected..
   no registry modifications are made by the virus...

   written just to personally discover the possibility of infecting .eml files...
