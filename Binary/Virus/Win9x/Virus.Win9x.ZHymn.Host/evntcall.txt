   macro:
           event   EV_xxx          <-- standard event call
   code:
           mov     eax, 00xxyyzzH  ; xx=caller plugin base
           call    ebp             ; yy=target plugin base, zz=plugin's event
                   ^^^ - ebp=loader's handleevent

   macro:
           eventX  EV_xxx
   code:
           push    ebp
           mov     ebp, [ebp]
           event   EV_xxx
           pop     ebp
                                      eventX
                                      ~~~~~~

     when EBP is used in this way:

           push    ebp            ; == enter nnnn, 0
           mov     ebp, esp       ;
           sub     esp, nnnn      ;

     dword at [EBP] holds previous EBP value, so eventX macro may be used.
