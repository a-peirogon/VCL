   So, that's my 1st PE infector, it work in ring3. His work is easy to
   understand: he allocate a timer then give back control to host.
   The timer proc will browse the entire hard drive till the host finish,
   while the host is working. For the rest, I think that thou are clever
   enough to understand how i don't modify import entries etc...
   Let's have fun!

   Note: that virus is quite old and he got a bug: some hosts, when
   closing it, happend to take all CPU time to call timer proc and
   then don't stop either the program either the virus ( u have to use
   ctrl-alt-del )
   Note: It's for educational purpose only! You can use it as you
   want, but I decline all the responsability in case of... etc. etc...
   That's in order to help newbies, so SV will log each files it (try)
   to infect in "c:\sv.log".

   Files:  Sv.Asm : the main body of the virus
           Defs.Inc : some useful stuff to easier the import part
   Not inclued here : Win32.Inc : some practical win32 constants etc.

   Note: some part of code are here commented, that are the calls to
   "MessageBox" when an infection is done or something like that,
   uncomment'em to have a complete overview of what happend.

   15 - 1 - 99 - n0ph - IKX - That's all folks!
