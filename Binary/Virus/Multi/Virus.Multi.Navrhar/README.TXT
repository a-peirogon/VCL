             Hello all VX collectors ( ... and fucking AverZ !)

Here is a virus you have been dreaming on. The world first direct Windows '95
VxD infector and the world second direct OLE2 infector.

Main features:
//////////////
- infects Windows '95 VxD's !!!
- infects Word 6/7 documents (like great Anarchy.6093 virus)

VxD features:
/////////////
Just look and see you fucking AVer ! No help for you.
Only for the best AV analysts !

Special features:
/////////////////
- infected documents aren't aligned to sectors
- main part of the macro (dropper itself) is placed at the end of infected file.
  This special feature causes automatically removing of dropper when infected
  file is saved (some kind of STEALTH :)
- some intentionaly bugs cause that macro AUTOOPEN cannot be removed from Word
  environment :)


           Who knows what brings the future ? (Navrhar)

BTW, if you don't know what the hell Navrhar means, I'm going to help you.
"Navrhar" [na:vrha:r] is "Designer" in English language.

GreetingZ ? You can find some of them in infected fileZ !

Big thanks goes to Microsoft for the best platform for viruses I ever seen :)
