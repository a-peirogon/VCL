       Virus Name: Cara.Kara.739

       The only reason I modified Cara.Standard.1024 is because I could not
       run it in any computer I have access to. Although a lot of changes
       had been made on the original virii, the functionality of the
       original routines had been retained.

       The changes made on this variant are:

       1. Use of 286 CPU instructions to shorten the virii a bit.

       2. Removed immunization of boot sectors as it might create problems
          against a stealth virii.

       3. Updated the boot virii checked for to those most reported in the
          wild, in the global perspective or in the Philippines.

       4. Translated text in virii to Pilipino. As a result, infection
          recognition mark had been changed to KARA instead of CARA.

       5. Removed retention of PSP as it is a waste of memory. Checks for
          program termination as well as Int 20 hook were also removed.

       6. Removed one-byte padding of the original virii.

       7. Instructions were implemented in a different way so that it would
          not be detected as Cara.Standard.1024.

       8. Instructions that trigger heuristic flags were hidden or presented
          in a discreet way.

       Regardless of the modifications made, this virii is still a Cara.


       The source code below was compiled in A86 version 4.02 and an
       infected file is in the debug script that follows the program
       listing.

       The source code was written in a way so that it could be compiled in
       most compilers available --- tasm and masm.

       You can be lamer but don't be stupid. This is virus. ok?ok?ok?ok?


    This is a file infected by Cara.Kara.739.

    To create an excutable program, cut the debug script below and save it
    as carakara.scr. Then type

         debug < carakara.scr

    The file carakara.com would be created.

    This is a file infected with a virii so be careful.
