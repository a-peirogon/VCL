    It is not a dangerous memory resident encrypted parasitic virus. It hooks
    INT 21h, then writes itself to the end of COM and EXE files that are
    executed or opened. The virus contains the text strings:

    !#TEMP#!
    REQUEST.IVA
    RECEIPT.IVA
    CALLFAST.COM
    *.*

    I am the man that walks alone
    And when I'm walking a dark road
    At night or strolling through the park
    When the light begins to change
    I sometimes feel a little strange
    A little anxious when it's dark

    While opening any ZIP file the virus scans the contents of the ZIP file for
    the REQUEST.IVA file. If there is no such one inside of ZIP, the virus
    creates the CALLFAST.COM file, writes into there the video-effect routine,
    infects CALLFAST.COM and appends that file to the files stored in ZIP.

    So the virus "infects" ZIP file, after "infection" the ZIP file contains
    infected copy of the virus.

    If there is the REQUEST.IVA file in the ZIP, and that file is of the special
    format (there is ID-string 92h,14h,76h,17h, and there is one or more file
    search pattern) the virus creates RECEIPT.IVA file, searches for the files
    are listed in the REQUEST.IVA file, copies them into RECEIPT.IVA, encrypts
    the result, and stores it into the ZIP.

    So the virus is able to "stole" the files from the computer and save them
    into the ZIP containing special REQUEST.IVA file.

    While processing the ZIP files the virus does not call PKZIP/PKUNZIP
    utilities, but parses by itself the internal ZIP format, reads/writes the
    ZIP records and adds new ones. While writing new data into the ZIP files the
    virus does not use compression, but writes it in not compressed form (ZIP
    method "stored").

    The virus dropper (the CALLFAST.COM file) contains the routine witch
    displays when executed:
