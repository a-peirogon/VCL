    MistFall.Z0MBiE-10.b (engine demo. also used: RPME, CODEGEN, LDE32, ETG)

    special thanx to S.S.R.
    greetz goes to Vecna, Mr.Sandman

    action:

    1. when infected PE file started, check (by means of Atoms) if dropper is
       alredy running, then exit; otherwise re-execute current program,
       leaving current process as main viral process.
    2. when main viral process is executed, build new permutating copy
       (slow-permutating) by means of RPME,
       then search for PE EXE files, and infect'em.

    infection method: (MISTFALL engine)

    1. disassemble file (fixups required)
    2. integrate with viral body
    3. assemble file

    infection details:

    - with probability of 1/10, insert bad word after each instruction
    - with probability of 1/10, infect without decryptor, just plain virus
    - with probability of 8/10, use polymorhic decryptor, see INFECT.INC

    So, poly-encrypted permutated viral body is completely integrated with
    target file. Hmm.. checkmate?

    version .a (ZMist)
    ~~~~~~~~~~

    - 9?% detections (anyway, good enough, for Peter Szor)

    version .b
    ~~~~~~~~~~

    - removed RSA-signing feature
    - removed 'Z'-sign from MZ header...
    - UEP prob changed from 1/10 to 1/5
    - decryptor scheme changed
