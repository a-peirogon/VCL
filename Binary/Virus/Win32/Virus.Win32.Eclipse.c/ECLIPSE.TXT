NAME: Win32.Eclipse v1.00
AUTHOR: Black Jack /LineZer0 /Metaphase
TYPE: spawning direct action .EXE infector
SIZE: 8192 bytes
COMMENTS: Of course this is a very simple virus, but it was my very first
	  step into the new school, and so I'm somehow proud of it. Also I
	  release it because I think that it may help other beginners in
	  win32asm, there are still much too few good tutorials out there.
	  Well, anyhow, the first step is done, expect to see a real PE
	  appender by me soon.

DESCRIPTION: This companion virus is a "regular" PE .EXE file with an own
	     header, sections, import table, etc. It infects all files in the
	     current directory by renaming them to filename.BIN and copying
	     itself to filename.EXE.
	     The running of the host is somehow complicated: first the host
	     file (renamed to .BIN) is opened, and it is checked if it is a
	     DOS or a Windows executable. If it is a DOS executable, it is
	     copied to filename.COM and run, otherwise the .BIN file is
	     executed directly. Why this complicated way? simple: the
	     CreateProcess API won't run DOS executables that have no .EXE/
	     .COM extention, and NE files with a .COM extension, but it does
	     not care if NEs have another extension, and PEs can have any
	     extension they want. So this way we can infect MZ, NE and PE
	     files. The .COM file of DOS executables is not deleted, btw,
	     this just made problems, because the file wouldn't be there
	     if it would actually get started.
	     An interesting thing of this virus is that the DOS stub of the
	     PE file contains the 16bit version of the virus code. Therefore
	     the virus can run in both plain DOS and any Win32 platform. You
	     could say this is the lamest multi-platform virus ever. ;-)

PAYLOAD: On August the 11th it will display a message box:

	   |                                              |
	   |                     [OK]                     |

	 On that day there was a total eclipse of the sun here in middle
	 europe, and my home town was exactly in the center. Also the
	 weather was ok. And therefore I'll never forget the wonderful
	 sight of the black sun.

DETECTION: Not detected by f-prot 3.05, avp 3.0.128, TBScan 8.08b,
	   DrWeb 3.27a.
	   Detected NOD 1.15 as "probably unkown COMPANION virus".
	   
ASSEMBLE WITH: 

tasm /M ecl_dos.asm
tlink ecl_dos.obj

tasm32 /mx /m ecl_win.asm
tlink32 /aa ecl_win.obj,,, import32.lib, ecl_win.def

the file ecl_win.def contains just one line:
	
	STUB 'ecl_dos.exe'


EXTRA SPECIAL THANKS go to X-Calibre from #win32asm on EFnet for helping me
                     with a problem that seemed very strange, but turned
                     out to be quite simple.
