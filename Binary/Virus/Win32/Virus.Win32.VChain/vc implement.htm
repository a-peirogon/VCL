<B>Implement</B><P>

After some months, I've sadly noticed it's harder to write the docs than the code...<BR>
<BR>
So, no more doc, nor low level comments about code.<BR>
In "Sources" section one can find "VC_by_module". It's the code splited in modules with some comments.<BR>
<BR>
Code is not indented, and uses linefeeds instead.<BR>
There are also 'fake' procedures, only for the code to look better.<BR>
<BR>
I've tryed to use a wide variety of technics to solve most of the situations one can find.<BR>
Just look at the code.<BR>
Or contact me, and ask for more.<BR>
