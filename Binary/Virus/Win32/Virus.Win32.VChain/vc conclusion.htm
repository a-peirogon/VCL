<B>Conclusion</B><P>

VirtualChain techology has been presented.<BR>
An example virus is provided.<BR>
<BR>
As seen in its first lines, can be compiled in tree independent modes.<BR>
By default, first generation will only infect target.exe in the same directory, and target.exe will only infect exes in C: root.<BR>
<BR>
Life time can be set. I think it would be better for all if all viruses have that.<BR>
By default virus will only be active this year 2002.<BR>
<BR>
It searches only in C: disk, looking for *.exe, using a deepfirst algorithm.<BR>
It won't infect other than PE files, with read&write access.<BR>
Target masks can be set; size, last access and probability.<BR>
By default, only looks for files smaller than 256KB, accessed during last week.<BR>
Not all this files will be infected; it depends on a final random factor.<BR>
And only up to 5 files can be targeted.<BR>
<BR>
It has an inoffensive payload (MessageBox).<BR>
Payload masks can be set; time and probability.<BR>
By default, payload will be shown only the first of each month, one time of eight program is ran.<BR>  
<BR>
At infection time, appends itself to the last section.<BR>
Thats the main reason it causes several antivirus trigger on.<BR>
No problem on that for me; I think my job is done.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So, technically, it's an autoreplicant program, win32 PE infector, direct action, polimorphic, inofensive, funny concept virus. <BR>
