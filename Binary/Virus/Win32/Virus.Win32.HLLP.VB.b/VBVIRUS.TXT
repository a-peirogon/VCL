   vbVirus by Murkry

   Well I need to learn VB or at least to become more familiar with the
   coding debbugging ect in VB. So I did what was dear to my heart and
   created a virus. I knew that other vb virus code was out there but most
   were companion. So I used some tricks from ASM , and C that I knew and
   applied them to VB a little reading of the help file and I was on my way.
   The manner I use to infect the file, I  believe standard High level Virus
   activity, copy the orginal host to the end of the virus and rewrite the
   entire file. On runing the infect file vbVirus Recreates an unifect file
   and shells out to it.The marker is I check for the letter M in a EXE header
   file. Read the sourcecode for more info. I use to dynamice byte arrays
   to copy the virus and the host into then concat them. I alter the exe stub
   so the msg now says

   "Program can not run due to Murkry Poisoning."

   I check for the M in Murkry
   Of course like other viruses that infect in this manner the icon is now
   the icon for the vbVirus. Which I am sure should be noticebale. Of course
   as soon as someone figures out the method MS uses to located icons in the
   .resc area we can copy that to our file and mimic the icon as well. I started
   this idea in vb code already, and can now find the first icon in an exe file.
   So I am sure it is a matter of time till this is done, then making viruses like
   cerebrus ,or Sandmans virus which was written in C, and other of this type
   will become more common place. Anyway read the code its sorta commented, Enjoy
   it I doubt I will update it any time soon. unless I really want to try to copy
   the icons in vb for some reason. I mean vb is nice but doing file access in it
   is like using a butter knife to cut cement. You can do it but why when you have
   a diamond tip saw.
