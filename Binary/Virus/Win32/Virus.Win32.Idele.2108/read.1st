                  IDELE virus version 1.9 July-December 2000


   Description:

   This is a per-process encrypted virus. It uses a new EPO (*) technic
   (as far i know), nothing is modified in the host code part.

   The virus searchs targets on C:,D:,E:,F: drives when ever those drives are
   accessible.

   The virus works fine on Win9x/Win nt4 platforms, but don't work
   on Win 2k platform.

   This virus is undetected at the time it was completed,
   yet it's not destructive, but it's a computer virus so use it at your own
   risks !

   I can't be held as responsible for use/misuse of this program.
   This program was only designed for research aims.

   (Is fire guns dealers can be held also as responsible for the death of
   a young guy somewhere in the world when someone uses a machine gun
   to kill him ?)
