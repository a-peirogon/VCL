   Virus Name: W32.Elysium
   AV Assigned: <undetected>
   Language: Visual Basic 6
   Author: Rott_En/DCA
   Purpose: Self-proof of slow, silent .exe infection in VB6
   Payload: <none>

   ---------------------------
   |Detailed Virus procedures|
   ---------------------------

   Shortly and to the point. Just a proof to myself that I can
   write a simple .exe infector in VB6. infects one file per run
   found in current directory. Rather harmless, uses custom
   encryption technique and inspired from The Hacker's Manifesto
   message payload (on each month with 31 days, on the 31 st, it
   displayes the following message:

   "You can stop this individual, but you cant stop us all!"

   -----------------------
   |Its just a concept...|
   -----------------------

   Yes, its just a small concept and needs a little more work.
   I was thinking to add it some kind of routine to get the
   infected file's icon, store it and then restore the icon
   so user doesnt get suspicious. It could also use a better
   encryption technique, i.e. encrypting each byte of the host
   with a more complex encrypt/decrypt method, still it works
   fine the way it is.
   Take it as a "template" for such a VB virus (rather powerless,
   but working and stable).
