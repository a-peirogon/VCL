                             [  Batch Worm Generator History  ]

 * version 3.02 - 16.06.2002
   Included a new Anti AV technique: Fake Lines!
   (seen in Duke's Advanced Batch Mutator v1.3)
   The ABM crpyted its batch virii in the same way as my BWG!

 * version 3.01 - 12.06.2002
   Killed the suspection from Duke/SWF's BAT Checker 1.5
   I think, BC 1.5 is the best BAT heuristic ever!
   Fixed a silly bug in the eMail routine!
   Fixed a bug in the vbs routine, because of the polymorphism!
   Made PIF dropping polymorph!


 * version 2.09 - 06.06.2002
   Killed Norton AV's virus BAT.BWG@mm ;-)
   Killed the KAV heuristic alarm Type_BAT, if only choose bat-infection!
   Made REG dropping polymorph
   Made VBS dropping polymorph
   Made LNK dropping polymorph
   Fixed a bug in the INTERNET-UPDATE routine

 * version 2.08 - 02.06.2002
   Added PIF file dropping!
   Added LNK file dropping!
   I tryed to add HTM(L) dropping, but
   my HTM files won't execute .bat files, or .vbs files!

 * version 2.07 - 31.05.2002
    wow... KAV worked a lot...
    but i didn't sleep:
    Killed    ~~> I-Worm.BWG
	~~> I-Worm.BWG.c
	~~> I-Worm.BWG.d
	~~> IRC-Worm.generic.bat
   I added Fake set lines!
   Added VBS file dropping!
   Fixed a bug in the pIRCh Part!

 * version 2.06 - 24.05.2002
   Fixed a bug in the part AV killing
   Fixed a small bug in the mIRC random!
   AV killing is more random
   Added Virc spreading!
   Added REG file dropping!
   Added some other AV programs...
   The worm will be saved as the "mail-file-name"!
   
 * version 2.05 - 22.05.2002
   Fixed a bug in the Registry Entry, but now does it work!
   Killed the KAV virus "I-Worm.BWG.c"
   Killed the KAV virus "I-Worm.BWG.b"
   Killed the KAV virus "I-Worm.BWG"
   Killed the KAV virus "IRC-Worm.BWG"
   Killed the KAV virus "Trojan.BAT.KillAV.b"
   Found out the secret of "Crypt.BWG" I have to say, that WAS nice *bg*
   Nice english in the program --> Thanks 2 VorteX
   Added system.ini infection!

 * version 2.04 - 18.05.2002
   Fixed bugs!
   KAV tried it again! ;-) I-Worm.BWG! But i found a new funny technique:
   I make every word random, not only every line!
   Now there are only some major lines generated with this technique!
   But I try to make the whole code with this technique!! ;-)

 * version 2.03 - 13.05.2002
   Added Registry Key
   Fixed a bug: If you choosed any option, then the BWG will include this lines in the next worms,
                         because the variable was even positive ;-)
   KAV don't detect any worm, even with heuristic! ;-)

 * version 2.02 - 05.05.2002
   KAV tried it again ;-) They detected some Worms as I-Worm.BWG.b
   Now the mIRC part it polymorph!
   Fixed some silly bugs!
   Made the mIRC spreading better!
   
 * version 2.01 - 28.04.2002
   Fixed a silly bug in the EICAR-file
   KAV detected the win.ini part, the vbs-part and the pIRCH-part
   as I-Worm.BWG (before as I-Worm.BWG.10)
   Now it's not possible for them  to detect any virus, because I've made all of them random!
   I think BWG will have a nice future!! ;-)


 * version 1.11 - 16.04.2002
   Fixed bugs:
   two in the "all file infection" function
   one in the "Internet Update" function
   one in the ".bat file infection" function
   one in the "logic hard drive" function

 * version 1.10 - 14.04.2002
   All filenames like hamlet.bat are polymorph now!
   Fixed two major bugs in the vbs-part!

 * version 1.09 - 13.04.2002
   Added INTERNET UPDATE
   Killed the virus I-Worm.pics
   the file email.vbs is a little bit random
   I think, KAV is really confused, because they find BWG 1.07
   as Constructor.DOS.I-Worm.Pics!?!
   AntiVir find some of my Constructors, but no BWG worms ;-)

 * version 1.08 - 11.04.2002
   KAV have found the vbs-worms of the BWG as I-Worm.pics.b,
   so I made the vbs-part very random!
   Added EICAR includeing!

 * version 1.07 - 09.04.2002
   Added WIN.INI dropping!
   You are able to kill AV programs and write a message!
   Added THANKS AND GREETS!
   Made Disk infection better (no Error if there is no Disk)
   Made the BAT infection better (not only current dir)
   Fixed one bug in Windows infection! 

  * version 1.06 - 07.04.2002
    Killed the virus IRC-Worm generic.bat!
    mIRC spreading is shorther and better than before!
    KAV is very silly, because it warns for the Constructor.BAT.BWG.104 
    if I make a new version (not infection),
    but it doesn't find any BWG virus *fg*

  * version 1.05 - 06.04.2002
    You are able to choose the Attachment from mIRC and pIRCh!
    Tricked the KAV Batch heuristic!! yeahh... ;-)
    Killed the virus BAT.Silly.d!
    Fixed some bugs!

  * version 1.04 - 04.04.2002
    Fixed some bugs!
    Added to choose infection of .BAT files
    I've tried to trick the heuristic of KAV, but I haven't
    success yet. But don't worry, I work at this! ;-)
    Now KAV find all my BWGs *fg*
    School is very hard (for me) and I won't be negativ in my
    first year, so I won't have as much time to make the BWG
    as now.

  * version 1.03 - 30.03.2002
    Added english start up infection!
    Outlook-spreading: You are able to choose your self subject and body!
    Fixed some bugs!

    
  * version 1.02 - 26.03.2002
    I added some metamorph stings! So every worm is different,
    also if the same has been choosen.
    [M2] does mean, this is a metamorph string with two different strings!
    Kaspersky Anti Virus find BWG 0.01 as Constructor.BAT.BWG.001 ;-)
    Fortunately it doesn't find the worm, which was made with BWG!!
    
  * version 1.01 - 24.03.2002
    I've fixed all bugs in this program!!
    Now the program get some funny technics! ;-)

  * version 0.05 - 22.03.2002
    Add a new IRC spreading: pIRCh

  * version 0.04 - 21.03.2002
    Add MS-Outlook spreading! 
    Now BWG looks very nice!!

  * version 0.03 - 20.03.2002
    Add mIRC spreading!
    Slowly BWG becomes be good!! ;-)

  * version 0.02 - 19.03.2002
    No more bugs! Add activating with a logic disk

  * version 0.01 - 15.03.2002
    Only Basic Construction! Some bugs
