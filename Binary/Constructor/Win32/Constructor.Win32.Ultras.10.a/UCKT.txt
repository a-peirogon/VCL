In the bottom given small tutorial for this constructor.
This constructor I has done much simply if choose payload it automatically 
puts:  U = Int(Rnd() * 30) + 1   <= generated day payload
       If Day(Now()) = U Then    <= a get day substitute in
       ......................    <= itself payload
       End if                    <= end
you may put (deliver) place this for instance:

If Day(Now()) = 5 And Month(Now()) = 9  Then <= if day is 5 but month 9 that works payload
............................................ <= But here you shutter any payload
End If                                       <= end

Place of days you will be able to put (deliver) friends of option:

If Month(Now()) = ? Then    <= where ? = any month
If Day(Now()) = ? Then      <= where ? = any day
If Year(Now()) = ? Then     <= where ? = any Year
If Weekday(Now()) = ? Then  <= where ? = any Weekday
If Hour(Now()) = ? Then     <= where ? = any Hour
If Minute(Now()) = ? Then() <= where ? = any Minute

Advisable under each payload do its day.
I Hopes that in 2 months to appear other version of this constructor.
