        because of some anti-av patching techincs used here,
        you should NOT directly use such instructions as:

        cmp ..., 'ZM'
        jxx ...

        cmp ..., 'EP'
        jxx ...

        Instead of it, use something like <cmp ..., not 'MZ'>

        Also, look into AAVPATCH plugin and learn some blocks of
        antiviral code which should never appear in your plugins,
        to avoid self-patch and possible following fuckup.
