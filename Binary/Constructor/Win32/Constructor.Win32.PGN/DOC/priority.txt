  Each plugin has 'PRIORITY' property.

  This is a number from 0 to 10, used to find order of calling plugins
  when distributing interplugin Events. Default priority is 5.

  When some plugin calls event, it calls LDRWIN32.Event subroutine,
  which will send this event first to plugins with priority=0, then 1,
  and so on, and plugins with priority=10 will be called last.

  If you're writing two plugins that should be activated on the same event,
  but with defined order of execution, just increase or decrease some
  plugin's priority by 1.

  4ex:
  when we've just entered ring-0, we want to perform
  1. av-vxd-kill actions
  2. some infection/residency
  and, it is obvious, that not vise versa.
