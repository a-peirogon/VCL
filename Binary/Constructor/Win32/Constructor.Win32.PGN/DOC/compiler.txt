       TASM          4.x+         set tasm32=x:\tasm32\

    Borland C++      5.x+         set bcc55=x:\bcc55\
        or
    C++Builder       3.x+         set bcc55=x:\borland\CBuilder3\

    all .CPP-sources must be compiled using PLUGIN namespace;
    this allows us to write own functions with standard names,
    such as malloc

    also, use
      extern "C" { ....... };
    for all the source code,  to disable cpp name mangling.
    (when function names are such as @PLUGIN@$unload$qul & etc)
