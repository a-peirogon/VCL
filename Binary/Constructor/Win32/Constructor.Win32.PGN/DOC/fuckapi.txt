   FUCKAPI
   ~~~~~~~

   This feature allows you to rename all imported/exported plugin/api names,
   using the following algorithm:

   1. if @-character prefixes string, it is copied into output string
   2. crc32 is calculated from string
   3. using calculated crc32 as a randseed, pseudo-random string is generated

   set PGN2_FUCKAPI=No          -- leave api names unchanged
   set PGN2_FUCKAPI=Yes         -- use 'A'..'Z' random chars
   set PGN2_FUCKAPI=Badly       -- use 1..255 random chars
                   ~~~~~~~-case-sensitive

   This feature is used, of course, to make disassembling a bit harder. ;-)

   NOTE: only interplugin-communication-related api names are modified,
   so, KERNEL32@Something-alike api names will not be changed.

   NOTE: when changing PGN2_FUCKAPI environment variable,
         you must rebuild ALL the plugins.
         Then use CHECK utility to verify all is ok.

   WARNING: when spreading is started with some defined PGN2_FUCKAPI type,
            you will be unable to change it in run-time.
            Recommended option for release version is PGN2_FUCKAPI=Badly
