   There are common plugins, which are used used by mostly all plugins.
   Common subroutines works both in ring3 and ring0.

   MEMORY  -- memory alloc/free
   RND     -- random number generator
   FILEIO  -- file access
   UTIL    -- registry & other stuff

   Note:
   Some common subroutines has __stdcall calling convention,
   not __cdecl or __pascal ones.
   __stdcall means that 1st argument is pushed last (ESP+4),
   but subroutine returns by RET <N>, where N=4*# of params.
   This is the same as win32 api does; these functions are
   malloc/mfree, fread/fwrite and some other.
