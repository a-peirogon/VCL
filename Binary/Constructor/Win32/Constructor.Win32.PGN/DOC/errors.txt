  1.    SEH errors are handled only while EVENT calls;
        i.e. when EntryPoint is called, no SEH is provided.

        When SEH error is handled, LDRWIN32 searches for error address,
        then for plugin that caused error, and then this plugin will be
        disabled. After that, imports/exports update operation is
        performed, and plugins, that uses erroneous one, and so on,
        are all disabled too.

  2.    PGN2 system is designed mostly for win32 ring-3,
        i.e. win9x/ring0 stuff is possible too, but,
        general logic shouldn't be ring0-based.

        All ring0-stuff should be as independent & short, as possible,
        'coz it is potential bugs.
        For example, when you've just entered ring-0, you in some cases cant
        perform correct file io; instead of it, you must allocate
        ring-0 memory, move your code there, then install some hooks,
        and only when activated there, perform file io.
