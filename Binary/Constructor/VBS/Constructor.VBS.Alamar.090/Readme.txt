*Stuff:
The worms crated whit the program are completly randomized, so you 
will never have 2 equal worms.

What does that mean?

That all the variables are randomized words of 10 characters, so, the
posibilities of having two equal words in a wordm are dificult, and 
the posibilities of having 2 equal worms are completily imposible.

You must be very carefoul when you edit the worm, becaouse if you
change a variable, you must change it every time it's shown.
______________________________________________________________________
*Features:

Start whit windows:
This make the worm be executed every time windows is started, so your
worm can try to infect or spread every day.

Worm backup:
It's just for having a copy of the worm in a safe place, so you can
be shure that it will no be lost.

Outlook Replication:
it uses the same function that all the vbs's, js's or any other kind of
worm, it sends a message, that you can define, whit te worm attached
to every preson in the user's address list.

Mirc replication:
Search for mirc.ini(what means that the mirc is there) in the most
commons floders(programfiles\mirc, c:\mirc, c:\mirc32) and if it 
is found, the worm create "script.ini" in that folder, that script make
the mirc sends the worm to every person that join to a channel.
(see "If found Mirc, infect.")

Pirch replication:
Same as mirc, but for pirch.

Infect Files:
The worm will search for all the hard drives (and the network drives 
too, i think) for files whit the extencion that you want(in this
version only .vbs are searched) and copy overwrite him whit itself.
*If found Mirc, infect:
This will make the worm to search also for mirc.ini, so if it find him,
it will infect the folder where mirc is. This method works 100% of the
times.

'To do a search for all the computer could take over 5 minutes, 
depending of the hard drive size.

Payloads:
These are stuff that you can addto the worm to be done.
  Message: shows a message box whit the text and the picture that
  you want.

  Open web address: open the web address that you want.

  When?: whit this you can tell the worm when do you wan to execute
  the payloads.
______________________________________________________________________

Ok, this is all that the program can make, maybe i forgot something,
i don't know.
I hope that you can learn something about Visual Scripting, it's
really easy an powerfull.
Visit www.virii.com.ar often if you wnna get the newest versions, i
think that the 1.0 will be finished in a week or two.

Have fun.
