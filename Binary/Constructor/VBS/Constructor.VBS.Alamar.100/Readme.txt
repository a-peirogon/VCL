Hi!:
Thanx for downloading the Vbs Worms Generator 1.0.
If you have any idea or code that i can add to the script please
contact me and i will add it.
Sorry for the bugs, after all, I'm just 17 years old!.
______________________________________________________________________
What's New:
*Some bugs fixed
*Added Anti deletion method.
*Some visual modifications.
*Can't remember anithing else.
______________________________________________________________________
What can be new?:
i'm working in html infecting, adding the code to the html, but no
deleting it,  modifying all shortcuts to redirect to your script,
made all favorites go to any site, and a lot of stuf that i'm thinking.

If you have any idea, please let me know.
______________________________________________________________________
*Stuff:
The worms crated whit the program are completly randomized, so you 
will never have 2 equal worms.

What does that mean?

That all the variables are randomized words of 10 characters, so, the
posibilities of having two equal words in a worm are dificult, and 
the posibilities of having 2 equal worms are completily imposible.

You must be very carefoul when you edit the worm, because if you
change a variable, you must change it every time it's shown.

Thanx to:
Pepe Lepu for helping me.
Mano/SunSoft_Team for the Pirch script.
All the people who contact me for the congratulations for this great
program!, i can name all her, but they know who they are.

I think that I haven't forget anybody, if i do, sorry.

*Features:

Start whit windows:
This make the worm be executed every time windows is started, so your
worm can try to infect or spread every day.

Worm backup:
It's just for having a copy of the worm in a safe place, so you can
be shure that it will no be lost.

Outlook Replication:
it uses the same function that all the vbs's, js's or any other kind of
worm, it sends a message, that you can define, whit te worm attached
to every preson in the user's address list.

Mirc replication:
Search for mirc.ini(what means that the mirc is there) in the most
commons floders(programfiles\mirc, c:\mirc, c:\mirc32) and if it 
is found, the worm create "script.ini" in that folder, that script make
the mirc sends the worm to every person that join to a channel.
(see "If found Mirc, infect.")

Pirch replication:
Same as mirc, but for pirch (i haven't tested the script cause i 
haven't got pirch, please someone test it and tell me if this work).

Infect Files:
The worm will search for all the hard drives (and the network drives 
too, i think) for files whit the extencion that you want(in this
version only .vbs and vbe are searched) and copy overwrite him whit itself.
*If found Mirc, infect:
This will make the worm to search also for mirc.ini, so if it find him,
it will infect the folder where mirc is. This method works 100% of the
times.

'To do a search for all the computer could take over 5 minutes, 
depending of the hard drive size.

Payloads:
These are stuff that you can add to the worm to be done.
  Message: shows a message box whit the text and the picture that
  you want.

  Open web address: open the web address that you want.

  Crash System: Creates 1Mb variables until the system goes down of
  memory

  When?: whit this you can tell the worm when do you wan to execute
  the payloads.

*Any idea?, contact me and i will add it!.

Save as fefault:
If you click this button in any window, the optionsselected are going
to be the same everitime you run the program, i thnk that it's nice.

Extras:
  Anti deletion method: The worm load all his source in memory, and
  if the worm is deleted is created again. The worm keeps running in
  memory.
