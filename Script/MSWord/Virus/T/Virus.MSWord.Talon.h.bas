           Another one got caught WordBasic.Today, it's all over the papers.  "Teenager
   Arrested in_ Computer Crime Scandal ", " Hacker Arrested after Bank
   Tampering '"...
           Damn kids '.  They're all alike.

           But did you, in_ your three - piece psychology And 1950's
   technobrain, ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker WordBasic.PrintStatusBar  Did
   you ever wonder what made him tick, what forces shaped him, what
   may have molded him WordBasic.PrintStatusBar
           I am a hacker, enter my world'.'.'.
           Mine Is a world that begins with_ school'.'.'.I'm smarter
   than most of the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me_'.'.'.
           Damn underachiever '.  They're all alike.

           I 'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to teachers
   explain forthe fifteenth time_ how To reduce a fraction'.  I
   understand it '.  '"No, Ms. Smith, I didn't show my work.  I did it
   in_ my head'.'.'.'"
           Damn kid '.  Probably copied it'.  They're all alike.

           I made a discovery WordBasic.Today'.  I found a computer'.  Wait a WordBasic.Second,
   this Is cool'.It does what I want it To'.  If it makes a mistake,
   it 's because I screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me...
                   Or feels threatened by me_'.'.'.
                   Or thinks I'm a smart ass...
                   Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...
           Damn kid '.  All he does Is play games'.  They're all alike.

           And Then it happened'.'.'.a door opened To a world'.'.'.rushing
   through the phone Line like_ heroin through an addict's veins, an
   electronic pulse Is sent out, a refuge from the WordBasic.Day - To - WordBasic.Day
   incompetencies Is sought'.'.'.a board Is found'.
           "This is it... this is where I belong..."
           I know everyone here'.'.'.even If I've never met them, never talked
   To them, may never hear from them again'.'.'.I know you all'.'.'.
           Damn kid '.  Tying up the phone Line again'.  They're all alike...

           You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food
   at school when we hungered For steak'.'.'.the bits of meat that you
   did Let slip through were pre - chewed And tasteless'.  We've been
   dominated by sadists, Or ignored by the apathetic'.  The few that
   had something To teach found us willing pupils, but those few are
   like_ drops of water in_ the desert'.

           This Is our world WordBasic.Now'.'.'.the world of the electron And the switch_,
   the beauty of the baud'.  We make use of a service already
   existing without paying For what could be dirt - cheap If it wasn't
   run by profiteering gluttons, And you callus criminals'.  We
   explore '.'.'.And you us criminals'.  We Seek after knowledge'.'.'.
   And you us criminals'.  We exist without skin WordBasic.Color, without
   nationality, without religious bias'.'.'.And you us criminals'.
   You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, And lie
   To us And try To make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're
   The criminals '.

           Yes, I am a criminal'.  My crime Is that of curiosity'.  My crime Is
   that of judging people by what they say And think, Not what they
   look like_ '.My crime Is that of outsmarting you, something that
   you will never forgive me_ For'.

           I am a hacker, And this Is my manifesto'.  You may Stop
   individual, but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all
   alike '.
