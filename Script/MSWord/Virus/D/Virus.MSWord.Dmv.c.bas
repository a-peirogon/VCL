   Rem This demonstrates an application-specific document virus
   Rem generated by an automatic macro in Microsoft Word for
   Rem Windows 6.0. Code is executed each time a document is closed.
   Rem This macro is only a demonstration, and does not perform any
   Rem destructive actions.

   Rem The purpose of this code is to reveal a significant security
   Rem risk in software that supports macro languages with
   Rem auto-loading capabilities.  Current virus detection tools are
   Rem not presently capable of detecting this type of virus, and
   Rem most users are blissfully unaware that threats can come from
   Rem documents.

   Rem Paste this code in the macro Window of a Word document
   Rem template. Save the macro as AutoClose.  Enter some random
   Rem text in the main word processing window and save the document.
   Rem Now copy the file, naming the new file VIRUS.DOC.  Open
   Rem VIRUS.DOC in Word.  It will appear as a normal document, but
   Rem when you close the document, the virus will execute.

   Rem Message boxes display progress as the code is executed.
   Rem Code is commented.

    Rem template instead of a document so the macro can be

    Rem to check names because the virus would be the only code
    Rem putting a macro in a document.
