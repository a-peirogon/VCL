     P800.<br>
     <br>
     This great Tri band smart phone possesses all the clever features of the P800
     and more, including a better appearance as this is a more robust design, and
     is finished in a very attractive graphite blue and silver colour design, the
     flip is also not transparent as it was with the P800 and the keys are now backlit
     slimline silver keys instead of the small plastic keys found on the P800. The
     flip is also different as when it is closed you can see more of the large TFT
     65,000 colour screen and the stylus has been changed so that it is more like
     a normal PDA stylus and slides into a hole at the top of the handset.
   <p class="ftw_text">The P900 has an integrated digital MPEG4 video player and still shot camera,
     and users can stream footage from the internet and send email or MMS messages
     with this as well as with home video clips and still digital shots, and also
     can save them to the phone memory, making this great for sharing clips and images
     with friends and family.
