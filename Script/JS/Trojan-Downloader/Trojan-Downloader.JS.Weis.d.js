<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='color:green'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Chinese authorities should immediately
release Dr. Jiang Yanyong, a government critic who exposed the government's
cover-up of last year's SARS epidemic, Human Rights Watch said today. Dr.
Jiang, 72 years old, and his wife Dr. Hua Zhongwei, have been heard from only
once since government agents arbitrarily detained them on June 1 while en route
to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing to obtain a visa.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Dr. Jiang's detention appears to have been
part of the government's crackdown on critics ahead of the fifteenth
anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre on June 4, 1989. He had publicly
called for a reexamination of the events surrounding the massacre. Several
dissidents were harassed and effectively subjected to house arrest. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
On June 1, Drs. Jiang and Hua left their home in an official hospital car and
were expected back in two hours. They have not been seen since. On June 4 one
of the couple's children received a note from Dr. Hua saying they were fine,
but suggesting that the family not plan for their usual summer vacation. On
June 8 officials notified their son he should deliver some of his father's
personal belongings to Chinese authorities. Such requests generally signal a
release is not imminent. No criminal charges have been filed against Dr. Jiang
and his wife. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&quot;When a courageous doctor points out the Chinese government's abusive
practices, he should be honored,&quot; said Sam Zarifi, deputy director of
Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. &quot;Instead, the government has detained
Dr. Jiang and held him incommunicado.&quot; &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Chinese authorities previously targeted Dr. Jiang in April 2003, when he
challenged the Health Ministry's assertion that only 19 people in Beijing were
suffering from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. Dr. Jiang's report
that there were at least 170 known cases forced the ministry to publicly reveal
the extent of the epidemic. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Human Rights Watch said that immediately after the SARS revelations,
authorities began shadowing Dr. Jiang and monitoring his communications. In
February 2004, he wrote a private letter to the National People's Congress and
other Chinese leaders detailing what he witnessed during the Tiananmen
massacre. In his letter, he proposed &quot;that we must correctly characterize the
students' patriotic movement on 4 June 1989.&quot; &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
In the wake of the letter, Chinese officials clamped down even harder on Dr.
Jiang. He has been pressured continuously to admit that writing the letter was
a serious political mistake. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Authorities at his place of employment, the No. 301 People's Liberation Army
Hospital, demanded he receive permission before attending even social events.
Officials screened all visitors to Dr. Jiang's home and quizzed him after some
guests departed. He was told he could no longer treat patients at other
facilities without No. 301's assent. Hospital authorities went so far as to
send a &quot;minder&quot; along when he traveled to Xinjiang to treat an old
patient. &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&quot;China wants to project an image of progress and rule of law, but Dr. Jiang's
arbitrary detention shows that this government is not bound by constraints --
save protecting itself,&quot; Zarifi said.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><span lang=EN-US>More Than 100 More House Church Leaders
Arrested</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>China Aid Association has learned from a
reliable source that more than 100 leaders of China Gospel Fellowship (CGF)
were arrested on June 11, 2004. The massive arrest took place at Wuhan city,
Hubei province while these church leaders were having a retreat together.
According to a senior house church leader and an eyewitness of the arrest both
of whom want to remain anonymous for security reason, about 50 police believed
from PSB of Wuhan City raided the church meeting around 2:00pm and arrested all
of the participants including one of the senior CGF leaders Mr. Xing
Jinfu(photo attached). Mr. Xing Jinfu, 39-year-old, was arrested at least three
times in the past for his church activities. He was sentenced to three years
re-education through labor in 1996 for his accused &iexcl;¡ãillegal preaching.&iexcl;¡À The
whereabouts of the arrested are still unknown. At the same day, according to a
reliable source of China Aid, the well-known leader of CGF pastor Shen
Xianfeng(photo attached) was put under house arrest at a residential area in
Wuhan city after the PSB thoroughly searched a house where Mr. Shen was
recovering from illness of his crippled legs. China Gospel Fellowship was
established in mid-1980s. It is one of the five major Chinese house church
groups with estimated at least five million members. <br>
China Aid also learned from an internal source of the Chinese Communist Party
that the Politburo of the CCP had recently convened a special secret meeting
discussing &iexcl;¡ãhow to deal with religious affairs in China&iexcl;¡À. According to the
source, a secret directive was issued after the meeting calling every level of
the Chinese government and the Party to crack down the &iexcl;¡ãillegal religious
activities.&iexcl;¡À The directive also urged the CCP&iexcl;&macr;s Department of Propaganda to
carry out a special media campaign to promote atheism. <br>
&iexcl;¡ãGiven the recent massive arrests of unregistered religious leaders in
different areas in China&iexcl;¡À, said Bob Fu, president of China Aid Association,
&iexcl;¡ãthe international community should be alarmed and take concrete actions to
urge the Chinese government to fulfill her signed pledge to protect her
citizens&iexcl;&macr; religious freedom mandated by relevant international human rights
covenants.&iexcl;¡À <br>
CAA urges the Chinese authorities to release these arrested church leaders
immediately. People of conscience in the US could send a letter of concern to
the Chinese embassy in Washington DC: <br>

unreasonable. &iexcl;¡À However, under the control of a leader from politics and law
commission, Tianjin PSB couldn&iexcl;&macr;t unfreeze the couple&iexcl;&macr;s deposit. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

bank committed a crime against her interest, why her deposit is frozen? <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p style='line-height:18.0pt'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:9.0pt;

Zhou Jian from 17th division of Tianjin PSB noticed Ma Ping couple to fetch her
deposit in Tianjin. The next day Ma Ping went there herself alone. Seeing only
one of the couple came, policemen there said nothing can be done, without Zhang
Mu. So Zhang Mu managed to get 17th division of Tianjin PSB. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Zhang Mu to be guilty. She was sentenced to a fixed-term imprisonment of 6

Mu were not convinced and appealed to the People&iexcl;&macr;s High Court of Tianjin. It
was accepted and heard on May 23, 2002, and held the court on September 23 the

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>VATICAN CITY -- The Vatican condemned on
Wednesday recent arrests of Catholic bishops in China, calling them a violation
of religious freedom. <br>
<br>
&quot;The Holy See feels deep pain for these actions, for which no explanation
has been given&quot; said a statement by Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro-Valls.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>The Vatican and China have no diplomatic
relations, and Chinese authorities have long sought to suppress underground
Catholic churches loyal to the pope. <br>
<br>
Navarro-Valls listed three recent cases. <br>
<br>
He said that since May 27 there has been no news on the bishop of Xuanhua, who
was taken into police custody. Another bishop in Xiwanzi was held from June
2-12 while the bishop of Zhengding was held for five days by authorities, the
Vatican spokesman said. <br>
<br>
He called the actions &quot;inconceivable in a state of law&quot; and said they
violate &quot;the rights of the person, in particularly religious freedom, that
are sanctioned in numerous international documents, also underwritten by the
People's Republic of China.&quot; <br>
<br>
Beijing only permits Catholics to worship in state-approved churches that do
not report to the pope.<b><span style='color:green'><o:p></o:p></span></b></span></p>
